#### Development process(Git line)

Below is picture of the development process when creating the program. When creating new features, feature branches were made.
When specific features were completed, a pull request was made, for other team members to test and accept.
There were two main branches, the master branch which only containd complete versions of the program and
the development branch where the actual development took place, when starting the web development of the program, a sub branc feature_webApp
was created which included branches where the actual web development took place.
